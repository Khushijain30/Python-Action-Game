# Python-Action-Game

This project is a text-based adventure game that I created as a part of a set of exercises. The game involves the movement of a protagonist around the game world and is built step by step through a series of exercises. The game uses Python and incorporates concepts such as dictionaries, functions, and loops.

The map of the game is defined as a dictionary, with keys representing the exits and values representing the identifiers of the rooms. The main function of the game is the game loop, which updates the current room based on the player's movement and displays a menu of available exits. The player's input is normalized using a set of helper functions.

I stored the project in GitHub, which allowed me to track changes and collaborate with others. I learned how to use the GitHub projects feature to manage the development process and keep track of tasks and issues. Throughout the development process, I tested the game using doctest and made sure that all the tests passed before moving on to the next exercise.
